# Famitracker Tools

A suite of utilities designed to enhance and streamline composition in [Famitracker](http://famitracker.com/), the premier tracker for authentic NES-style chiptune music.

As a dedicated Famitracker user, I've often run into the limitations of manual editing and repetitive tasks. This project addresses that by providing tools that operate directly on Famitracker‚Äôs text export format ‚Äî enabling more powerful manipulation, automation, and creative control.

## üöÄ Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Accelerate the NES-style composition process
- Provide a clean, extensible codebase as a technical showcase
- Serve as a launchpad for experimental tooling in tracker-based music

---

## Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates:
- **Modular architecture** with a professional code layout and `Makefile`-based build system
- Use of **Design Patterns**: *Facade*, *Strategy*, *Abstract Factory*
- **Advanced Regex** techniques for parsing and tokenization
- Robust **file I/O** operations for reading/writing large text-based music formats
- Integrated **logging** for traceability and debugging
- **Unit tests** to ensure correctness and prevent regressions

## Tools Overview

### 1. **Famitracker Text Export Parser** *(WIP)*  
Parses `.txt` exports from Famitracker into structured, navigable data.  
Encapsulates pattern data, instruments, macros, and control codes into a usable intermediate format.

### 2. **Famitracker to MIDI Converter** *(WIP)*  
Translates parsed Famitracker data into a MIDI sequence using a custom `MidiWriter` engine.  
Allows playback and interoperability with modern DAWs or synthesis tools.

### 3. **Auto-Inject Vibrato Tool** *(WIP)*  
Automatically adds vibrato macros to long notes across patterns.  
A massive time-saver ‚Äî no more manually entering vibrato hundreds of times.
